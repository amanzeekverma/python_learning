# python_learning
This is my transition from Java guy to python crap

Also, the problems has been taken from various coding sites, 

List (to be updated):
* Leetcode


The uploads are not designed to cheat but a personal/learning repo, use discretion, I am not a python guy when starting to work on this repo. So, basically dont assume the solution to be best/good.
